# To Do
## Short Term
- Basic for loop
- Break statement
- Continue statement
- intrinsic print function
- type casting

## Longer Term
- Structs
- Constructor like rust
- Destructors
- Struct properties
- Replaceable symbols for intrinsic functions that were generated by default

## Long Term
- Templates
- Compiled macros
- Tuples
- default not impemented exception if body is a semicolon
- User defined conversion
- exceptions
- Arena for new operations and cleanup
- Add some kind of table to each backend that allows fast generation of intrinsic operators/functions
- multi module compilation
- Unit testing
- Documentation
- Default parameters
- Named arguments
- Folder based modules? not sure what this meant
- Methods for primitives
- interfaces
- variadic functions that use param array (handle with variable length array?)
- validation of unsafe operations
- Optimization of operations between literals
- Warning for unused variables/parameters
- Warning for unused values from function returns
- Borrow checking lmao
- Disallowing the use of moved (made invalid by move) structs
- Range checking for arrays
