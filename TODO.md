# To Do

## Short Term
- Explicit casts for typecontext
- Add "Potential Solution" and "Extra Information" logs
- Multi line snippets & highlights
- Prefix operators
- Subscript operators
- mut values and stopping modification of const values

## Longer Term
- Custom allocation for new
- While loops
- Regular loops
- Structs
- Member access expressions
- Indirection expression '->'
- Constructors
- Destructors
- Struct properties
- Replaceable symbols for intrinsic functions that were generated by default
- Default parameters
- Unit testing
- Documentation
- references
- pointers

## Long Term
- Templates
- Macros
- Tuples
- default not impemented exception if body is a semicolon
- User defined conversion
- exceptions
- Arena for new operations and cleanup
- Add some kind of table to each backend that allows fast generation of intrinsic operators/functions
- multi module compilation
- Named arguments
- Methods for primitives
- interfaces
- variadic functions that use param array (handle with variable length array?)
- validation of unsafe operations
- Optimization of operations between literals
- Warning for unused variables/parameters
- Warning for unused values from function returns
- Borrow checking lmao
- Disallowing the use of moved (made invalid by move) structs
- Range checking for arrays

## End Goals
- C Interoperation
- C Generation
- LLVM Backend
- WASM Backend
